# BubbleTeaGame
Inspired by the Lemonade Stand and Coffe Shop games on Cool Math Games, this Bubble Tea Shop simulates managing your own Bubble Tea Shop, giving kids an interactive and fun opporunity to learn about statistics, finance and customer relations.

This game was created as my final project for my Grade 12 Computer Science course, and some related documents sharing my planning process and challenges are included.

There are many factors that go into a customer's decision to purchase. I used gaussian distributions to effectively simulate the spending habits and preferences of customers based on a number of factors including the reputation of the shop, conditions, temperature, recipe etc. Using customer feedback, players can adjust their recipe and pricing to improve their reputation, all while ensuring they do not run out of money and stock.

# Instructions for Use
1. Open the BubbleTeaGame folder
2. Open the Java application (PNG and highscore.txt must be present in the same folder for the application to work properly)
3. Check out the source package in src>bubbleteagame to read my code!
2. Have fun!

*Try and see if you can beat the highscore!*
